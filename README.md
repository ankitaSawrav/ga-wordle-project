General-Assembly Project 1 Wordle

**Wordle** is a word game that’s gone viral in 2022, but many people are still learning what Wordle is and how to play.

This is my attempt of building [Wordle](https://ankitasawrav.github.io/ga-wordle-project/wordle.html) as my first GA-Project. It is built using HTML, CSS and javascript.

As someone who wasn't aware of the details of the game it was fun to learn to play the game while building it.


##Rules(how to play the game):

Wordle is an online 5-letter word game. Each day a new word is released and players have six attempts to guess the word. During the guesses, tiles change colour to help players get the word.
- A grey letter means it isn’t in today’s word
- A orange letter signals it is in the word but in the wrong position.
- there’s the green letter which means it’s in the word and in the right place.

Players select letters of the alphabet on the virtual keyboard and enter them into the 5 blank tiles. When they’re happy with their 5-letter word guess, they press the submit button. This then checks the word and lets you know if your word or some of the letters are correct. If it’s completely right – the full 5 letters turn green.

### Functionality:

Following are the funtionalities that I implemented:

- Virtual keyboard to take user inputs, which are displayed on tiles.
- Check for valid word, and display error to user when an invalid word is provided.
- Change tiles and keys color based on accuracy with that attempt.
- Display the user with the message whether user won or lost.
- Allow user to play another game by refreshing.

##### Things to work on :

- Take input from keyboard instead of virtual keyboard
- Provide stats around wins and losses.
