General-Assembly Project 1 Wordle

**Wordle** is  the simple word game that’s gone viral in 2022, but many people are still learning what Wordle is and how to play.

You might have seen those tiny red, amber and green tiles shared on the group chat or posted on social media and wondered what it could be. Or watched your colleague frantically google search a number of 5-letter words? If that’s the case, chances are they’re obsessed with the game of the moment: Wordle.

The simple word game is a great 5-minute daily brain-teaser to do on your lunchbreak or commute. And parents might find it to be a fun car game for kids too, helping to keep them quiet and entertained on the school run. If you haven’t tried your hand at the online game as yet, here’s what you need to know to play along.

##Rules:

Wordle is an online 5-letter word game. Each day a new word is released and players have six attempts to guess what the word of the day is. During the guesses, tiles will change colour to help players get the word.
- A grey letter means it isn’t in today’s word
- A # yellow letter signals it is in the word but in the wrong position.
- there’s the green letter which means it’s in the word and in the right place.

Players select letters of the alphabet on the virtual keyboard and enter them into the 5 blank tiles. When they’re happy with their 5-letter word guess, they press the submit button. This then checks the word and lets you know if your word or some of the letters are correct. If it’s completely right – the full 5 letters turn green.
